# This is my website! Check it out!

This is the source code of my website. The generated HTML is stored in the
master branch, for Github's benefit.

## Initial setup

It's fairly simple: `bundle`. That's all. You should be able to run the default
task in rake. (Running `rake` with no arguments, spawning `middleman server`)

## Neat things:

- Run `rake article blah blah blah` to create a new blog post entitled 'blah
  blah blah'.
- Run `rake deploy` to push the resulting code to github and my server
